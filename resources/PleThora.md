## Dataset Information

The PleThora dataset is a database of chest CT images, which includes segmentation data of thoracic cavity and pleural effusion from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The dataset involves 402 computed tomography (CT) images collected from the "NSCLC-Radiomics" data. These images have manually annotated bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes.

Thoracic segmentation primarily encompasses normal, pathological, and atelectatic lungs, hilar structures, pleural effusions, fibrosis, nodules, tumors, and other anatomical abnormalities. These segmentations were initially auto-generated by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer. Subsequently, these auto-segmentations were manually corrected by medical students to include the entire thoracic cavity and revised by a radiation oncologist or radiologist. The segmentation of pleural effusion was entirely manually done by medical students and revised by radiologists or radiation oncologists. The correction results between two doctors showed acceptable consistency.

Furthermore, the PleThora dataset also provides tabulated clinical and technical metadata related to segmented cases. This data helps in developing image analysis processes for pathological lungs, which are the most challenging part for current automatic algorithms. Combined with the already available overall tumor volume segmentations in "NSCLC-Radiomics," pleural effusion segmentation may be very valuable for studying radiographic feature differences between effusions and primary tumors or training algorithms to differentiate them.

These expert-reviewed segmentation data are publicly available in NIfTI format through TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive), allowing researchers to conveniently use and analyze these data.
