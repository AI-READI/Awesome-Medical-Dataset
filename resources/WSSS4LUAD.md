## Dataset Information

**WSSS4LUAD** is a dataset and challenge focused on weakly supervised semantic segmentation of lung adenocarcinoma tissue. The dataset comprises 87 whole-slide images (WSIs) sourced from the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (GDPH) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with 67 images from GDPH and 20 from TCGA. The training set includes 10,091 image patches with image-level labels, while the validation and test sets feature over 130 million pixel-level annotations. These annotations were collaboratively generated by pathologists and AI models and rigorously reviewed by experts.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, obtaining precise semantic pixel-level annotations for tissues is extremely challenging and time-consuming. The goal of this challenge is to develop algorithms capable of semantic segmentation for three key tissue types in lung adenocarcinoma: tumor epithelium, tumor-associated stroma, and normal tissue, using only image-level labels. Contestants are required to train their algorithms with only image-level multi-class labels (3-class classification) and evaluate their performance using pixel-level ground truth for validation and testing.

The **WSSS4LUAD Challenge** advances pathology image segmentation through weakly supervised methods, aiming to reduce reliance on expensive pixel-level annotations while improving accuracy and efficiency in identifying lung adenocarcinoma tissue. This initiative not only offers new approaches for pathology research but also lays a solid foundation for supporting lung cancer diagnosis, enhancing clinical workflow efficiency, and facilitating the deployment of intelligent cancer image analysis tools.

(a) The authors scanned 67 pathological slides from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital and downloaded 20 WSIs from TCGA. During the data annotation process, an expert, two senior pathologists, and eight junior pathologists were invited to annotate the image-level training samples and pixel-level validation samples, respectively. Figures c and d show some examples of the training set, validation set, and test set.</em></p>
